# Data Model

## Core idea: separate references from content

A URL the user cares about can show up in multiple places — bookmarks, browser
history, a read-later queue, a highlight. The *extracted content* of that URL
is the same regardless of where the reference came from. So:

- **`documents`** is the universal, deduplicated content table, keyed by
  normalized URL.
- **Reference tables** (`bookmarks`, `history_entries`, `highlights`, ...) point
  *at* documents. The same document can be referenced multiple times from
  multiple sources.

In v1 only the `bookmarks` reference table exists, but the schema is shaped so
that adding `history_entries` later is purely additive.

## When to add a new reference table vs. a new `content_type`

A common point of confusion: if curio starts handling PDFs, YouTube videos, or
GitHub repos, do those get new reference tables?

**Almost always no.** The rule:

> A new **reference table** when the *way the user encountered* the content is
> meaningfully different. A new **`content_type`** when only the *format* is
> different.

Reference tables capture the **origin story** — how the user came to care
about this thing, and what metadata that origin carries.

- Bookmarks have a folder path and tags.
- Browser history entries have visit count and dwell time.
- Highlights have a quoted passage and an optional note.
- Read-later items have a read/unread state.
- Local files have a file path and mtime.

`content_type` captures the **shape of the content** — what fetcher to use
and what extraction metadata to expect.

- `article`, `pdf`, `video`, `repo`, `thread`, ...

Applied to common cases:

| The user encountered... | Reference table | `content_type` |
|---|---|---|
| A bookmarked arxiv PDF | `bookmarks` | `pdf` |
| A bookmarked YouTube video | `bookmarks` | `video` |
| A bookmarked GitHub repo | `bookmarks` | `repo` |
| A page in browser history | `history_entries` (future) | `article` (or whatever fits) |
| A PDF on local disk dragged in | `local_files` (future) | `pdf` |
| A Pocket-saved article | `read_later` (future) | `article` |
| A Readwise highlight | `highlights` (future) | inherited from document |

The PDF case is the clearest illustration: a bookmarked PDF and a local PDF
share the same `documents` row shape and `content_type='pdf'`, but they enter
the system through different reference tables because the metadata about
*how the user got there* is fundamentally different.

## Multi-tenancy

`tenant_id` lives on every **top-level** entity:

- `bookmarks`, `history_entries`, `highlights` (reference tables)
- `jobs`
- `cluster_runs`, `clusters` (insight layer)

Child tables (`documents`, `chunks`, `document_extractions`,
`cluster_documents`) **do not** carry `tenant_id`. They are reached only
through a parent reference, so the JOIN implicitly enforces tenant scoping. This keeps row size sane and avoids the
redundancy of marking every chunk with a tenant when its document already
belongs (transitively) to a tenant via its references.

For single-user local installs, `tenant_id` is always `"local"`. For hosted
deployments, it'll be a UUID per customer.

**User IDs** are deliberately not added in v1. When hosted-mode lands and we
support team plans, we'll add `created_by_user_id` as an audit column on
reference tables — distinct from `tenant_id` (which is the customer/org), not a
replacement for it.

## Documents are shared, references are not

If the same URL appears in your bookmarks *and* later in your browser history,
you get **one** document and **two** reference rows. This:

- Saves re-fetching and re-embedding
- Lets the insight layer reason about "I encountered this from multiple
  sources" as a strength signal
- Makes `documents.url` a deduplication key

A document's `tenant_id` is implicitly the tenant of any reference that points
at it. In hosted mode, if two tenants bookmark the same URL, they get
*separate* document rows — we don't share extracted content across tenants
(privacy + extraction can be tenant-specific later, e.g., authenticated
fetches).

## Schema (v1)

### `documents`

Universal content table. One row per (tenant, URL).

```
documents
  id                    UUID PK
  tenant_id             TEXT NOT NULL          -- implicit via references, denormalized for query convenience
  url                   TEXT NOT NULL          -- normalized: lowercase host, no fragment, sorted query params
  url_canonical         TEXT                   -- post-redirect, if different
  content_type          TEXT                   -- 'article' | 'repo' | 'video' | 'pdf' | 'thread' | 'unknown'
  title                 TEXT                   -- extracted; may differ from any reference's title
  author                TEXT
  published_at          TIMESTAMP
  language              TEXT
  word_count            INTEGER
  current_extraction_id UUID                   -- FK to latest successful extraction
  state                 TEXT NOT NULL          -- 'pending' | 'fetched' | 'failed' | 'dead'
  created_at, updated_at
  UNIQUE (tenant_id, url)
```

Why `tenant_id` is denormalized here: every search/list query filters by tenant,
and joining through a reference table on every search hurts. The constraint is
enforced at write time by the importer/crawler.

### `document_extractions`

Each fetch attempt produces a new extraction row. Lets us keep history of how a
document has changed and which fetcher produced it.

```
document_extractions
  id                UUID PK
  document_id       UUID NOT NULL FK
  fetched_at        TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
  fetcher           TEXT NOT NULL              -- 'web2md' | 'jina' | 'github' | 'youtube' | 'pdf'
  status            TEXT NOT NULL              -- 'ok' | 'partial' | 'paywalled' | 'error'
  markdown_path     TEXT                       -- relative to ~/.curio/content/
  raw_path          TEXT                       -- original HTML/JSON, optional
  extraction_meta   JSON                       -- fetcher-specific (repo stars, video duration, ...)
  error_message     TEXT
```

`documents.current_extraction_id` points at the latest successful row. Older
rows are kept for diff/history (could be GC'd by a future retention job).

### `chunks`

```
chunks
  id                UUID PK
  document_id       UUID NOT NULL FK
  extraction_id     UUID NOT NULL FK           -- chunks belong to a specific extraction
  ord               INTEGER NOT NULL
  text              TEXT NOT NULL
  token_count       INTEGER
```

Two virtual tables sit alongside:

- `chunks_fts` — FTS5 over `chunks.text`, plus boostable columns for
  `documents.title` and `references.tags` (denormalized at index time).
- `chunks_vec` — sqlite-vec, keyed on `chunks.id`, holds the embedding.

When the embedding model changes, both virtual tables are rebuilt (see
[embedding model swap](./decisions.md#embedding-model-swap)).

### `bookmarks` (reference table)

```
bookmarks
  id                UUID PK
  tenant_id         TEXT NOT NULL
  document_id       UUID FK                    -- linked at ingest; NULL only if the document is deleted
  url               TEXT NOT NULL              -- denormalized for fast lookup
  title             TEXT                       -- title at save-time (from the browser)
  saved_at          TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
  source            TEXT NOT NULL              -- 'chrome' | 'safari' | 'firefox' | 'manual'
  folder_path       TEXT                       -- '/Tech/AI/Agents'
  tags              JSON                       -- string array
  created_at, updated_at
  UNIQUE (tenant_id, url, source)              -- one bookmark per (tenant, url, source)
```

A bookmark is saved together with its document in one transaction
(`BookmarkStore.Ingest`): the document is found by `(tenant_id, url)` or
created `pending`, the bookmark is linked to it, and a fetch job is enqueued
only when the document is new. The same URL bookmarked in several browsers
is one document, fetched once.

### Future reference tables (not in v1)

These are sketched here to validate the schema's extensibility. Don't
implement until needed.

```
history_entries (tenant_id, document_id, visited_at, dwell_seconds, visit_count, source)
highlights      (tenant_id, document_id, text, note, highlighted_at, source)
```

Both follow the same pattern: their own table, FK to `documents`, own
source-specific fields.

### `jobs`

```
jobs
  id            UUID PK
  tenant_id     TEXT NOT NULL
  kind          TEXT NOT NULL                  -- 'fetch' | 'index' | 'cluster' | 'summarize'
  payload       JSON NOT NULL
  document_id   UUID FK                        -- → documents(id), ON DELETE SET NULL
  status        TEXT NOT NULL                  -- 'pending' | 'running' | 'done' | 'failed'
  attempts      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
  run_after     TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now
  last_error    TEXT
  started_at    TIMESTAMP                      -- set when claimed
  created_at, updated_at
```

`document_id` is the document a fetch or index job works on. It is the
payload's `document_id`, copied into a column when the job is inserted;
the payload keeps it, since the API returns payloads verbatim. It is NULL
for a job that names no document (cluster), and for a job whose document
has been deleted: the foreign key is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so the job's
history (its `last_error`, its durations) outlives the document. A job
whose payload names a document that doesn't exist can't be enqueued.

Workers claim with a single `UPDATE jobs SET status = 'running' ... WHERE
id = (SELECT id FROM jobs WHERE status = 'pending' AND kind = ? AND
run_after <= now ORDER BY run_after, created_at LIMIT 1) RETURNING ...`, so
jobs are claimed in the order they became runnable. `idx_jobs_claim
(status, kind, run_after, created_at)` turns a one-kind claim into an index
seek and the first row, however many jobs are queued. Failed jobs get
exponential backoff via `run_after`.

### `cluster_runs`

One row per clustering execution. The clusters of the latest `done` run are
what surface as interests.

```
cluster_runs
  id                UUID PK
  tenant_id         TEXT NOT NULL
  status            TEXT                       -- 'running' | 'done' | 'failed'
  algo              TEXT                       -- clusterer name, e.g. 'knn-graph'
  params            JSON                       -- clusterer parameters + the engine's center flag
  num_documents     INTEGER
  num_clusters      INTEGER
  num_noise         INTEGER
  error             TEXT                       -- nullable
  started_at        TIMESTAMP
  finished_at       TIMESTAMP                  -- nullable
  created_at, updated_at
```

### `clusters`

One row per cluster within a run. `cohesion` is the mean member cosine to the
cluster centroid (the normalized mean of its members' vectors).

```
clusters
  id                UUID PK
  tenant_id         TEXT NOT NULL
  run_id            UUID NOT NULL FK           -- → cluster_runs(id), ON DELETE CASCADE
  label             TEXT                       -- nullable; topic name
  summary           TEXT                       -- nullable
  size              INTEGER
  cohesion          REAL                       -- mean member cosine to centroid, 0..1
  created_at, updated_at
```

### `cluster_documents`

Cluster membership, one row per (cluster, document). Noise docs simply have no
row.

```
cluster_documents
  cluster_id        UUID NOT NULL FK           -- → clusters(id), ON DELETE CASCADE
  document_id       UUID NOT NULL FK           -- → documents(id), ON DELETE CASCADE
  similarity        REAL                       -- cosine to centroid, 0..1
  PRIMARY KEY (cluster_id, document_id)
```

### Deferred insight tables (not in v1)

Sketched for completeness; not yet built. In M4, interests are surfaced
directly from labeled clusters (no standalone `interests` table), and
suggestions arrive with M5.

```
interests    (tenant_id, name, summary, evidence_cluster_ids JSON, confidence)
suggestions  (tenant_id, kind, payload JSON, created_at, dismissed_at)
```

## URL normalization

Critical for dedup. The normalized URL is both the dedup key and the URL
that gets fetched, so normalization never changes which resource it names,
and applying it twice changes nothing. It accepts only http(s) URLs with a
host, lowercases scheme and host, drops default ports and fragments, turns
an empty path into `/`, removes common tracking params (`utm_*`, `fbclid`,
`gclid`, ...) and sorts the remaining query params; query pairs it can't
decode are kept rather than dropped. Implementation lives in
`internal/urlutil/normalize.go` (one place, one impl, table-tested and
fuzzed). See `docs/decisions.md` "URL normalization: fetch-equivalent and
idempotent".

## On-disk content layout

```
~/.curio/content/
  <document_id>/
    <extraction_id>.md
    <extraction_id>.raw.html      # optional
    <extraction_id>.meta.json     # mirror of extraction_meta, for grep-ability
```

Keeping content on disk rather than in SQLite:

- Database stays small and fast to back up
- `grep`/`ripgrep` works directly against the corpus
- Easy to delete a document's content without DB surgery

## Schema versioning and migrations

Migrations live in `migrations/` and run via `pressly/goose` at daemon startup.
The schema version is the highest version in goose's `goose_db_version`
table, the one source of truth for it. The daemon copies it into
`.curio-meta.json` after migrating, as a cache for `/v1/healthz`,
`curio version` and `curio doctor`. Downgrade is not supported — backup
before major version bumps.
